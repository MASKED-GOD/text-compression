Great! Here’s a clean and clear **README.md** for your Huffman Compressor project:

---

# Huffman Compressor

This project implements a general-purpose file compressor and decompressor using the Huffman coding algorithm.
It includes:
✅ A C++ program (`huffman_general.cpp`)
✅ Sample executable (`huffman_general.exe`)
✅ Example input files (`random.txt`)
✅ Example compressed files (`random.huff`)

---

## 📦 Features

* Compress any file (text, binary, etc.) using Huffman coding.
* Decompress `.huff` files back to their original format.
* Save and load Huffman trees for accurate reconstruction.
* Command-line usage for flexibility and automation.

---

## 🏗️ Build Instructions

To compile from source:

```bash
g++ huffman_general.cpp -o huffman_general -std=c++17
```

Make sure you have a C++17-compatible compiler (e.g., GCC 7+).

---

## 🚀 Usage

### Compress a file

```bash
./huffman_general compress <input_file> <output_file>
```

Example:

```bash
./huffman_general compress random.txt random.huff
```

---

### Decompress a file

```bash
./huffman_general decompress <input_file> <output_file>
```

Example:

```bash
./huffman_general decompress random.huff recovered.txt
```

| --------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `huffman_general.cpp` | Source code for the Huffman compressor. |
| `huffman_general.exe` | Precompiled executable (Windows).       |
| `random.txt`          | Sample input text file.                 |
| `random.huff`         | Sample compressed Huffman file.         |

## ⚙ How it works

* **Compress:**

  1. Read input file.
  2. Build frequency table.
  3. Construct Huffman tree.
  4. Generate codes and encode data.
  5. Save tree + encoded data to `.huff` file.

* **Decompress:**

  1. Read `.huff` file.
  2. Reconstruct Huffman tree.
  3. Decode bitstream to original data.
  4. Write to output file.

---

## 💡 Example

Compress:

```bash
./huffman_general compress random.txt random.huff
```

Decompress:

```bash
./huffman_general decompress random.huff recovered.txt
```

---

## ✅ Requirements

* C++ compiler with C++17 support (if building from source).
* Works on Windows, Linux, macOS (cross-platform).

---

## 📝 Notes

* Only use the provided executable on Windows.
* For large files, compression ratios depend on data redundancy.
* ASCII and binary files are both supported.

If you want, I can also write a **LICENSE** file or a **CHANGELOG.md** to go with this! Want me to draft that too? 🌟
